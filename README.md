Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor: -
This repository contains code and resources for predicting gold prices using a Random Forest Regressor. The model was trained on a dataset spanning several days over a period of 10 years. We evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.

Dataset: -
The dataset used for this project is available in the file gold_price_dataset.csv. It includes historical data related to gold prices, such as daily prices, market trends, and other relevant features.

Model Training: -
We employed the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to build our predictive model. Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and handle non-linear relationships.

Usage: -
1.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.	Install the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn) thorough Dependencies.
3.	Run the Jupyter Notebook file Project_Gold_Price_Prediction.ipynb to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Results: -
Our trained model achieved promising results in predicting gold prices. Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters or feature engineering techniques to further enhance its performance.

Acknowledgments: -
We thank the gold industry and the open-source community for their valuable contributions.
